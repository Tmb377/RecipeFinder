# RecipeFinder
## Final Project for Applied Internet Technology Fall 2015

## Overview

This website allows users to register and login in order to look through recipes (using the Yummy API) based on search criteria that they choose. Users may then choose their favorite recipes to save to their account and may also add the ingredients for recipes to a grocery list that will combine the ingredients from all of the recipes that they have chosen and separate them by recipe for easy organization.
